### **Unit Converter - Simple Yet Expanding Project** ğŸš€  

This is a **basic unit converter** built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Kotlin**. It allows users to easily convert between different units such as **centimeters, meters, feet, and millimeters**.  

### **Current Features:**
âœ… Select input and output units from a dropdown  
âœ… Convert values instantly  
âœ… Clean and minimal UI using **Material3**  

### **Planned Improvements:**
ğŸ”¹ Add more unit categories (weight, temperature, etc.)  
ğŸ”¹ Improve UI with better design elements  
ğŸ”¹ Implement ViewModel for better state management  
ğŸ”¹ Add animations for smoother interactions  

I built this project as part of my **Android development journey**, and I will keep improving it as I **learn more and enhance my skills**.  

**Stay tuned for updates!** ğŸ˜Š
